# NorthwindReact
This React demonstration project was created using Visual Studio Code 1.49, React 16.13.1, and ASP.NET Web API (Visual Studio 2019 16.5.4, .NET Core 3.1.201, & EF Core 3.1.3).  Material Design is used.  Redux is used to address React UI Framework state management.  Redux Thunk middleware is used with Axios for HTTP client data retrieval with functions.  The objective is to demonstrate React CRUD functionality consuming a Northwind Web Api project.
